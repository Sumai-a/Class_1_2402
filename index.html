        <h3>How to work with AI responsibly</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Review and personalize AI-generated content to meet your client’s unique needs.</b> Got some great content from an AI tool? Make sure you don’t just copy and paste it and send it over to your client. Review it. Edit it. Make sure it fits with your client’s brand and style and that it matches their tone and voice.<br><br>

            <b>Be transparent with your clients about your use of AI tools.</b> It’s great that you’re working with AI! Just make sure your client knows that this is a tool you are using. As always, being open and upfront about your process with a client is very important.<br><br>

            <b>Uphold client confidentiality and protect sensitive information.</b> Don’t upload any information into an AI tool that may be confidential or private. Instead, find ways to use the tools that don’t require sharing any sensitive information<br><br>

            <b>Embracing AI in your freelancing journey is a game-changer.</b> It can save you time, enhance work quality, and set you apart in a competitive market while ensuring ethical practices. Becoming familiar and experienced with these tools is a great way to improve your expertise as a freelancer, and continue to exceed your clients’ expectations.<br><br>
